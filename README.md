# arrakis
Arrakis is a research project exploring a new, topology-driven definition of biological species.
Instead of relying on classical phenotypes or taxonomic conventions or genes/group of genes, Arrakis uses high-dimensional genomic embeddings, topological invariants, and pangenome structures to identify and delineate species as stable n-dimensional volumes in genomic space.

Modern datasets—such as GTDB or large metagenomic collections—allow us to represent each genome as a point in an embedding space (e.g., FCGR, panspace embeddings, or learned representations). Arrakis investigates how the shape of these genomic clouds encodes species boundaries, ecological structure, and evolutionary history.

## Core ideas

Species emerge as topologically coherent regions in high-dimensional genomic space.  Betti numbers, persistent homology, and geometric clustering provide invariant descriptors of these regions. Pangenome graphs and genomic embeddings, and other genome-wide metrics can be compared as matching topologies.

**This framework is compatible with optimal transport, guilds, and ecological interaction layers.**

## Goals

Build a full pipeline to compute and analyze topological signatures from genomic embeddings.

Evaluate species boundaries across genera.

Integrate pangenome graphs (e.g., from PanGraph/PanG) with embedding topology.

Explore theoretical implications for evolutionary biology.

## Why “Arrakis”?

Inspired by the spice-species wordplay and Dune’s universe, “Arrakis” evokes a landscape with hidden structures—mirroring how genomic space contains intrinsic shapes that define life’s diversity.
